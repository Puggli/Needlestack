Needlestack is a static web file server that serves file stacks (as opposed
to individual files).  It is based loosely (heavily) (entirely) upon Facebook's
Haystack, with notable differences being the lack of an explicit in-file index
as well as the use of a (poorly implemented) trie isntead of Google's sparse
hash table.

Dependencies include:
    -libevent (for http serving)
